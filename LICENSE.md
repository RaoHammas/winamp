# Winamp Collaborative License (WCL) Version 1.0.2

This License governs the use, modification, and distribution of the **Mighty Winamp** software. By using, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree to the following totally reasonable and not at all confusing terms:

## Preamble

Welcome to the **Winamp Collaborative License**! It's free, it's copyleft, and it’s all about making sure you have fun with code (while following the rules, obviously). We want you to use, tweak, and study Winamp until your heart's content, but we’ve got a couple of quirks—just like that one dev who swears by semicolons in Python.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS (Don’t worry, it’s not *that* bad)

### 1. Definitions

- "**This License**" means version 1.0.2 of our fine-tuned legalese masterpiece.
- "**The Program**" refers to the glorious software licensed under this. You know, the thing that whips the llama's a**.
- "**You**" refers to anyone who dared download or fork this, also known as "The Brave Developer."
- "**Modify**" means you tried to break... er, I mean improve the code. 
- "**Covered Work**" refers to the unmodified Program or any frankensteined version of it you come up with.
- "**Convey**" means you sent it to someone. Carrier pigeon, email, floppy disk... it's all Conveying.

### 2. Basic Permissions

Feel free to run Winamp all day and night! Loop it, script it, go wild. Whatever comes out of it is yours... unless it’s still our code—then it’s ours. Your fair use rights are safe, too; we’re not monsters.

### 3. Grant of License

You get to peek at the source code! Yes, we mean the *good stuff*. Modify it all you want, **in private**. No distributing your “1337” mods though—we prefer to avoid Winamp turning into some weird Frankenstein’s monster of code spaghetti.

### 4. Contributions

- **Contribution to Project**: Fix that bug? Add that feature? You rock. Send it back our way, and we’ll think about adding it to the official version. We might say, “Oh, cool!” or “Nah, we’re good.”
- **Assignment of Rights**: By contributing, you're basically giving Winamp your secret sauce. We get to use it forever (muhahaha), and no, you won’t get a parade for it—but thanks anyway!
- **Waiver of Rights**: You won’t have to deal with people calling your code “ugly” or “mangled” because you won’t even get the chance to complain. Fair? Not really. But hey, legal stuff.

### 5. Restrictions

- **No Distribution of Modified Versions**: You’re a wizard at modifying code, but alas, no public showcase. Only the official team gets to spread the gospel of Winamp.
- **Official Distribution**: Let the official repo handle distribution. Trust us, it's safer this way.

### 6. No Sublicensing

You can’t pass this license off like a hot potato. Section 5 already has that covered—no need to complicate things.

### 7. Anti-Circumvention Shenanigans

No, you can’t lock up our software with DRM or make it the Fort Knox of apps. This is an open party. Bring chips, not walls.

### 8. Disclaimer of Warranty (The “Good Luck” Clause)

Here’s the deal: the software is *as is*. If it breaks, you’re holding the pieces. No warranties, no promises, not even a smiley face sticker. Use it at your own risk.

### 9. Limitation of Liability

If Winamp causes your server to spontaneously combust, wipes your hard drive, or just refuses to whip the llama, we are *so not responsible*. You’ve been warned.

### 10. Termination

Mess up with these terms, and we’ll have to say goodbye. At that point, you’ll need to destroy every copy of Winamp you’ve got, including that one backup you forgot about from 1999.

### 11. Copyright Protection

We’re keeping the rights to this masterpiece. You can use it, but don’t go claiming you wrote Winamp from scratch at a hackathon. Keep all the little legal notices intact. You break it, you lose it. Simple.

### 12. Patent Rights

Got a patent? Cool! But let us use it if it touches the Program. Start a patent lawsuit? Oops, you just lost your patent license. Maybe stick to coding instead of suing.

### 13. Trademark Usage

You can’t just slap the Winamp name on your app and call it a day. Trademark rules still apply, so don’t embarrass yourself.

### 14. Privacy and Data Protection

If you decide to collect data with Winamp, remember: privacy laws are a thing, and you should follow them. Yes, even if it’s just for the email addresses of your closest 10 friends.

### 15. Support and Updates

Support? Updates? From us? Don’t hold your breath. If we’re feeling generous, we’ll throw you a bone, but otherwise, you’re on your own.

### 16. Compliance (A.K.A. “Be Cool”)

You need to follow all the rules and laws, okay? Don’t go all cyberpunk rogue on us.

### 17. Miscellaneous

- **Governing Law**: Belgium’s got dibs. Any problems? Take it up with the fine folks of Brussels.
- **Severability**: If a part of this License gets trashed in court, the rest will keep on truckin’.

By using or contributing to Winamp, you’re basically nodding and saying “Sure, I’ll follow the rules, but I also love reading lengthy legal documents.”
